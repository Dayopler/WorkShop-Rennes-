101 Dlatoniens


101 Dlatoniens is an extension that helps developers create websites for the people with colorblindness by allowing them to simulate the experience those users have on websites.

The extension works by placing a CSS filter over the webpage that modifies color ratios in line with actual types of colorblindness.

There are 8 different settings to experience:

Blue Cone Monochromacy / Achromatomaly
Monochromacy / Achromatopsia
Green-Weak / Deuteranomaly
Green-Blind / Deuteranopia
Red-Weak / Protanomaly
Red-Blind / Protanopia
Blue-Weak / Tritanomaly
Blue-Blind / Tritanopia
